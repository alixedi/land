# land

I took the landing page template from Tailwind and hooked it up to Github pages and Netlify CMS. [Here](https://www.notion.so/dripluk/16-1-Land-Ahoy-d8a86d70ba79454f8f7c48c1586a5422) is the blog post with videos etc.

I am going to write docs on setting this up soon so watch this space but if you want to have a go right away:

1) Fork this repository.

2) Follow [this blog](https://cnly.github.io/2018/04/14/just-3-steps-adding-netlify-cms-to-existing-github-pages-site-within-10-minutes.html) for instruction on how to set up Netlify CMS.
