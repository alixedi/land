## Introduction

**August 2019**

The *Blue Team* launched a new feature for the *CRM* (Customer Relationship Management) software used by ~5k people at the DIT.

This feature let our users cc an email bot in calendar invites for meetings. The bot would *parse* the calendar invite, automatically create an interaction record for it in the CRM and send a link to the relevant people.

The project came about from a discovery that pointed out that our users wanted more SalesForce-like features in the CRM - for example, better email integration.

We built the thing in ~4 months - dotting all the Is and crossed all the Ts -

- **We were Agile** - Backlog, Trello board, 2-week-sprints, planning at the start, demo and retro at the end, etc.
- **We cared about our users** - The project was preceded by a couple of months of meticulous user research, the journeys were painstakingly mapped out, every detail covered, every copy reviewed.
- **We followed good engineering practices** - sound architecture, great code quality, near-perfect test coverage, etc.
- **We delivered -** The brief was to build the email bot, we delivered a working email bot, according to the specs, on time.

![DIT show and tell clapping](../assets/uploads/building-things-that-users-need/dit.png)

Yes, there was clapping & congratulatory emails but this picture is from the internet

Over the course of the next few months, we discovered that our thing was used by **exactly 5 users**.

<aside>
üî• We did an excellent job of buiding something that no one needed

</aside>

I joined the Blue Team at DIT in June 2019. Before that, I had worked 15 years at startups. Many of which also did an excellent job at building something that no one needed. Some of them didn't live to tell the tale.

![The most common mistake startups make is to solve problems no one has - Paul Graham](../assets/uploads/building-things-that-users-need/pg-mistake.png)

In the aftermath of the email bot project, I discovered 2 things -

1. The Blue Team was receptive to ideas on building things that users need & they provided me with a safe space to share my (startup) experience with them.
2. The senior management was happy to let the team take responsibility for delivering **outcomes instead of solutions**.

## Outcomes over solutions

Company records in our CRM were a mess. In order to fix them, DIT bought access to the [D&B](https://www.dnb.co.uk) - A database of validated, global company data. The idea was to replace the company records in our CRM with those from D&B. This had several benefits - the primary one being that D&B kept their company records up to date (unlike our users).

Over the course of the next few months, we rolled-out several work-packages to integrate D&B with our CRM -

1. We built a **New add-a-company journey** that let our users search for D&B companies and pull them into the CRM instead of having to type e.g. company addresses and telephone numbers into forms.
2. We were able to migrate about a quarter of existing company records in our CRM to D&B by writing scripts that **automatically matched company records in our CRM to D&B.**
3. We designed the journey to **get our users to match the remaining company records to corresponding D&B records.**

In each of these work-packages, we progressively developed a way of working that mitigated the risk of not building things that users need.

By the time we reached the last bit, we had consensus on certain guiding principles -

## 1/ The Needle

Every project needs a *north star* so that the team can correct course periodically. A metric that objectively proxies intended outcomes is a good north star.

For example - for the D&B integration project we agreed on the following -

<aside>
üî• 50% companies "looked-at" in our CRM would be matched to D&B

</aside>

![50% company pages in our CRM would be matched to D&B](../assets/uploads/building-things-that-users-need/needle.png)

We called it **the needle** - as in - 'we want to move the needle for our users'.

We were 100% transparent about the needle and its motion. We put the needle on a dashboard. We put this dashboard on a big screen. We put the big screen in the center of our workspace.

Knowing what success looks like, encoding it in a metric, and putting the metric on a dashboard is *nice* for any project. But, if you want to build things that users need, it is *critical*.

## 2/ Hypotheses

For each iteration of our project, we put down a list of **hypotheses** that might move the needle.

![List of hypotheses that might move the needle](../assets/uploads/building-things-that-users-need/hypotheses.png)

For example - for the final work-package i.e. getting our users to match company records to D&B, we listed the following -

- **Carrot** - If we tell our users the benefits of matching company records to D&B, our users will match company records to D&B
- **Stick -** If we tell our users that the company records that are not matched to D&B will be archived, our users will match company records to D&B

We were open to all ideas  üòÖ

![If we incentivise our users, they would match the comapnies](../assets/uploads/building-things-that-users-need/carrot.png)

![If we de-incentivise our users, they would match the comapnies](../assets/uploads/building-things-that-users-need/stick.png)

The vocabulary for this is important. *Hypothesis* underlines the fact that we have finite confidence in the success of any of these propositions.

## 3/ Experiments

Armed with a list of hypotheses, the team would come up with *cheap* experiments to validate them.

Again, vocabulary is important. *Experiment* underlines the fact that the outcome is *learning*. Learning about the product, about the market, about our users.

![Designing experiments to test the hypotheses](../assets/uploads/building-things-that-users-need/experiments.png)

---

**A side-note -** The hypotheses-experiment thing has an interesting side-effect. Learning about the product, and about users is no longer an exclusive function of product managers and user researchers respectively. I feel it is important for x-functioning teams to not degenerate into What & How functions in order to avoid problems like the following -

![An illustration about the bridge between planning and execution](../assets/uploads/building-things-that-users-need/balls.png)

---

The experiments were a lot of fun and it was where a lot of the magic happened. More on this later.

![Constraints drive creativity](../assets/uploads/building-things-that-users-need/move.png)

# 4/ Pivot

At the end of each iteration, we would gather around the needle and ask ourselves a single question -

> What did we learn?
>

If a hypothesis was validated by our experiments, we would continue down that path.

If a hypothesis didn't hold up to experimentation, we would try something else.

Try something else meant coming up with a new list of hypotheses; Naturally - informed by what we have already learned. Try-something-else is also called a *pivot*.

## Summary

To sum it all up -

- Figure out the **needle** (Measure)
- Generate **hypotheses** - ideas on how to move the needle (Learn)
- Design **experiments** to validate hypotheses (Build)

Also known as - **build-measure-learn** loop. Except - you don't do it in that order the first time üòä

![The build-measure-learn loop](../assets/uploads/building-things-that-users-need/build-measure-learn.png)

## An Example

**Getting our users to match comapny records to D&B**

### 1/ The Needle

50% companies "looked-at" in our CRM would be matched to D&B

### 2/ Hypotheses

We decided to start with the carrot i.e. If we tell our users the benefits of matching company records to D&B, our users will match company records to D&B.

### 3/ Experiment

Surely, the only way to test our hypothesis was to build the matching system? The problem with this was that matching company records to D&B had 100s of corner cases. For example -

- Companies can have branches
- Some companies are registered locally in different countries
- Companies dissolve
- Companies have mergers

Building software that **just worked** ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è  for all (or even most) of these corner cases would take too long. It would not be cheap. It would also not be an experiment.

Remeber this?

![Constraints. Drive. Creativity.](../assets/uploads/building-things-that-users-need/move.png)

Constraints. Drive. Creativity.

In one of our sessions, the team came up with a clever hack that would allow us to test the hypothesis without spending 6 months not building things that users need.

Here is how it worked -

**Call to action**

We would put the following message at the top of the page for company records that were not matched to D&B records -

![Call to action screenshot](../assets/uploads/building-things-that-users-need/call-to-action.png)

**Matching**

We had already built the following for our **new add-a-company journey**. We repurposed it for the matching -

![Matching journey screenshot](../assets/uploads/building-things-that-users-need/matching.png)

**The Flintstones Car**

As soon as a user found a match for a company, a small function was triggered in our *Frontend* code. This function sent an email to ZenDesk, creating a ticket that said -

> A user wants to match X company record with Y D&B record
>

To the user, we said - "We will get back to you" -

![We will get back to you screenshot](../assets/uploads/building-things-that-users-need/we-will-get-back.png)

That's it. No companies were actually matched. No records updated. Not yet.

At the end of the workday, our product manager would go through the list of tickets, double-check if they made sense, and completed the matching process **manually.** He also took note of any corner cases and discussed them with the team.

In startup terms, this is called - **doing-things-that-don't-scale**.

From our users' perspective, it looked and felt like we had built the matching thing in a couple of weeks. In fact, we built this -

![Flintstones car](../assets/uploads/building-things-that-users-need/flintstones.png)

**Like a proper car -**

- A *Flintstones car* looks like a car (at least from a distance)
- A *Flintstones car* can also take you to places you want to be (albeit at walking pace)

**Unlike a proper car -**

- The *Flitstones car* took a a couple of weeks to build and cost 100x less
- The *Flintstones car* validated that a car is indeed what users needed
- If the *Flintstones car* failed, we had 2 weeks less than the total time for the project to try other things

The last point is super-important. You can generally bet on good x-functioning teams to *eventually* find the product-market fit. But often, this doesn't happen on the first try.

If your project plan is set up to release exactly **one** perfect version of whatever it is you are building, it's like buying a lottery ticket.

## Some notes

There are several associated points here that I would like to make but they would make this essay too long -

- The relationship between building things that users need & agile is similar to the relationship between strategy and tactics respectively.
- Proper x-functioning teams are necessary for building things that users need. Proper x-functioning teams are not split into (1) What & (2) How functions. Proper x-functioning teams have specialists and not gatekeepers.
- It is surprisingly easy to sell this to senior management. They are generally quite happy with teams taking responsibility to deliver outcomes instead of features.
- The Flintstones car is also known as - an üí•  *MVP*  (Minimum Viable Product). If we had built shitty half-ass software for matching companies that broke on every corner case, it would not be an MVP, it would be a prototype. Shared vocabulary - slashing the cost for communicating ideas by ~100x for centuries.
- There are dozens of [known MVP patterns](https://www.robotmascot.co.uk/18-types-of-minimum-viable-product/) in addition to the Flintstones car.
- The following is a poor (but PowerPoint-friendly & therefore popular) illustration of what an MVP means. If you really want to build the MVP for a car, see how Tesla did it.

    ![A popular but inaccurate illustration of MVPs](../assets/uploads/building-things-that-users-need/powerpoint-mvp.png)

- The Flintstones car **tested poorly**‚Ñ¢Ô∏è  in user research. While it was producing insane metrics. This is a different article that I might write another time but tl;dr Random sampling from what is essentially a long-tail distribution is as mad for user research cohorts as it is for stock portfolios.
- The engineering for building things that users want is very different to regular engineering. This is also true to a lesser degree for product management.

## Sources

Nothing I have described in this document is novel or ground breaking.

In fact, I have been dancing around terms like MVP (Minimum Viable Product) because I realize that they been overloaded to an extent that it doesn't mean anything anymore. This is most unfortunate but a topic for another discussion (or a rant) at another time.

![The Lean Startup cover](../assets/uploads/building-things-that-users-need/lean-startup.png)

The Lean Startup introduced us to - minimum viable products, build-measure-learn, and pivots and laid out a reproducible method to build products that users need.

![The Startup Way cover](../assets/uploads/building-things-that-users-need/startup-way.png)

The Startup Way translated these principles to established enterprises and introduced embedded startups.

All we did was to -

- take what has been shown to work elsewhere (primarily startups)
- convince the stakeholders to adopt some of it
- in a large public sector organisation here in the UK
- have good results to show for it

The Flintstones car became a thing at DIT. We did versions of it in several other projects. Other teams did the same.

## Hello üëã

I am Ali and I have built dozens of products in this way at some exciting (& successful) startups in the UK and elsewhere.

Some of these products are still in production and used by millions of people. I am doing it again with [dripl.co.uk](http://dripl.co.uk) and I am [building it in public](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Unstartup-4f4ea12d2c8b4e97be3fce5667a08d17).

I generally do not care for job titles but when pushed, I like to say that I am a **Product Engineer**. A product engineer is someone who -

- Understands products better than most engineers
- Understands engineering better than most product managers

(Most technical co-founders and CTOs [in internet-era startups](https://public.digital/2018/10/05/why-hire-an-internet-era-cto-what-will-they-actually-do) are product engineers)

I joined [public.digital](http://public.digital) in August last year. I believe that there is a better, reproducible, scientific way of building things that users need. It is about time the public sector catches up to this.
