    description: >-
      We created Dripl because we wanted to find out if we could build a
      profitable internet business together. Between us, we spent 20 years at
      startups. This means:


      **Half of Dripl is an un-startup.** We are building digital products but we are not seeking hockey stick growth, looking for venture capital, or working 100-hour weeks.


      **Half of Dripl is a consultancy.** We advise clients on adopting Lean Startup principles in the enterprise. This helps us fund the un-startup, but we are also very good at this.

      About **175,000** people take the [Life in the UK
      test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_in_the_United_Kingdom_test) every
      year to qualify for residence. Ainy was one of them last year. She tried
      several apps on the App Store to help her prepare for the test but didn't
      like any of them so we decided to build an app she would love.


      During our research, we found that **5 out of the top 20** best-selling apps on the App Store were for test-preparation so we took a step back & built an engine that transforms a spreadsheet of multiple-choice questions into a beautiful, singing-and-dancing test-preparation app for the iPhone.


      We are dogfooding the engine to build an app for the Life in the UK test. This will be followed by more test-preparation apps until we feel we have something reproducible. At this point, we might launch the engine as a **no-code solution for building test-preparation apps.**

      We are big fans of the [Lean Startup
      methodology](http://theleanstartup.com/principles) and every product at
      Dripl is built on the same principles. 


      If you like the planning, strategy, and execution for the un-startup, **we can help you do the same** for your product or business. [Please reach out  ](mailto:hello@dripl.co.uk) and we will be happy to discuss if we can help you and how.
