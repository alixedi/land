      rings. The rings move as you learn new chapters and attempt mock tests.

  - title: The HazardGuide show you exactly how you will be scored
    description: >-
      Our smart HazardGuide shows you exactly how you will be scored on the real
      test. This way you can learn to spot the developing hazards quickly.


      All the latest 34 Hazard Perceptions videos from DVSA are included in the ADI Theory Untangled app.


      P.S. The additional clips - that some apps claim to have - are unofficial and often not up to date.

      text: This app is absolutely amazing- it's definitely a top-class testing
        program that tests your knowledge of Driving both for Theory and Hazard
        Perception - I highly recommend it. 😊 👍
      stars: ADI ★★★★★
    - text: There is no set number of mock tests and you can give as many tests as you
        want. The app shows the previously attempted tests and notes their score
        so you can see your progress. The rings on the home page show your
        status and distance to your goal.

      text: This was the second app I bought for the ADI theory practice. My first app
        was the official app from the agency that takes the test. I tried to
        practice with it for a month but I kept losing focus and kept forgetting
        as I went forward. Then I downloaded the untangled app because they also
        promised to have the same DVSA material. I was surprised to notice that
        I was actually memorising what I was learning. The progress circles are
        also a great way to keep track of the practice.
faqs:
  - title: What if the ADI Theory Untangled not right for me?
    text: No problem! Just send an email and we'll refund you, no questions asked.
  - title: How long does it take to prep for the theory test?
    text: Unlike other apps, we do not recommend a personal plan. Instead, we have a
      universal progress tracker i.e. the rings. You should book your theory
      test when the rings close. Revise while you are waiting for the test.
  - title: Why should I buy the ADI Theory Untangled app instead of the official
      DVSA app?
    text: >-
      We have licensed the official DVSA revision bank and hazard perception
      clips and so our app has the same content as the official app.


      In addition to DVSA-licensed content, the ADI Theory Untangled app has exclusive features that are designed to help you over the line. For example - hazard guide, instant search, smart revision and a universal progress tracker.
  - title: Why does the ADI Theory Untangled app have only 34 hazard perception clips?
    text: >-
      The 34 hazard perception clips in the ADI theory Untangled app are the
      only hazard perception clips that are being licensed by DVSA at the
      moment.


      Other apps that claim to have more clips are either not official or worse - old clips that are not compatible with the current hazard perception test requirements.
  - title: Does the ADI Theory Untangled app work on the iPad or Android Tablets?
    text: >-
      Yes! The ADI Theory Untangled app works on the iPad as well as Android
      Tablets.


      In fact, we have made certain adjustments so that our users have a pleasant experience with a larger screen.
  - title: Is the ADI Theory Untangled app easy to use?
    text: Yes! We have designed the ADI Theory Untangled app to be easy to use.
      Every feature, every detail is meticulously designed to help you get our
      users ready to pass the ADI theory test.
