      learning, in one place. You can always refer to this section after every
      practice or after completing the whole practice.


      And once your test date approaches, you can just go to the Review section and go through the list of challenging questions that you frequently got wrong in the past and practice just those.

  - title: What is the format of US Civics Test?
    text: >-
      US Civics test is not a multiple-choice test. During the naturalization
      interview, a USCIS officer will ask you up to 10 questions from the list
      of 100 questions in English. You must answer correctly 6 of the 10
      questions to pass the civics test.


      The 100 civics (history and government) questions and answers for the naturalization test are listed in our Practice section.


      On the naturalization test, some answers may change because of elections or appointments. As you study for the test, make sure that you know the most current answers to these questions.
  - text: We think that you can easily prepare for your test between 3-5 days, if
      you are preparing exclusively. If not, we have a universal progress
      tracker in the form of rings. You can see the rings progressing as you
      move on with your practice. You should book your test when the rings
      close. Revise while you are waiting for the test by giving mock tests.
    title: How long does it take to prep for the civics test?
  - text: >-
      Absolutely! You can give unlimited mock tests. The mock tests in US
      Citizenship Untangled app are timed, so you get a taste of the actual
      test.

    title: Can I prepare for my civics test by just giving mock tests?
  - text: Yes. All 100 questions in US Citizenship Untangled app are in accordance

  - text: Applicants are given two opportunities to pass the naturalization test. If
      you fail any part of the naturalization test at your first interview, you
      will be retested only on the portion of the test that you failed, between
      60 and 90 days from the date of your initial interview.
    title: What happens if I fail the test?
  - text: >-
      If you have a physical or developmental disability or mental impairment
      that prevents you from demonstrating your knowledge and understanding of
      the civics requirements for naturalization, you may qualify for an
      exemption to certain parts of the naturalization test. You must submit an
      original  N-648 form at the time of filing Form N-400. 


      Form N-648 must have been prepared by a licensed medical or osteopathic doctor or licensed clinical psychologist less than six months prior to filing Form N-400.
    title: Is there a test exemption for physical or mental disability or impairment?
  - text: >-
      Certain applicants are exempt from the English requirements for
      naturalization and may take the civics test in the language of their
      choice. These candidates come under the category of 65/20 Special
      Consideration.


      According to this category If you are 65 years or older and have been a green card holder for 20 or more years, you only need to study the 20 designated test questions.
