      learning, in one place. You can always refer to this section after every
      practice or after completing the whole practice.

        There wouldn't be a simpler app than this for Life in UK tests. No
        signups required, no clutter of advertisements, no activation or
        personal information is asked.


        It has simple Q& A layout. Explanations to Answers particularly helped me learn more about the subject.


        God for users at any knowledge level.

  - title: What is the format of US Civics Test?
    text: >-
      US Civics test is not a multiple-choice test. During the naturalization
      interview, a USCIS officer will ask you up to 10 questions from the list
      of 100 questions in English. You must answer correctly 6 of the 10
      questions to pass the civics test.


      The 100 civics (history and government) questions and answers for the naturalization test are listed in our Practice section.


      On the naturalization test, some answers may change because of elections or appointments. As you study for the test, make sure that you know the most current answers to these questions.
  - text: We think that you can easily prepare for your test between 3-5 days, if
      you are preparing exclusively. If not, we have a universal progress
      tracker in the form of rings. You can see the rings progressing as you
      move on with your practice. You should book your test when the rings
      close. Revise while you are waiting for the test by giving mock tests.
