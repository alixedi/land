      text: Passed after practicing for 2 weeks I found reading from Discover Canada
        quite hard and I kept forgetting the dates. Your app has a really nice
        way of helping memorize dates and events. I had no plans to prepare from
        anything else except Discover Canada but my roommate referred this app
        and Im so grateful that she did. I passed my test after practicing 2
        hours everyday for 2 weeks.

  - title: Why should I buy Canadian Citizenship Untangled app instead of the
      official Handbook?
    text: >-
      Canadian Citizenship Untangled has carefully curated 600 plus practice
      questions, straight from *Discover Canada* handbook. While keeping the
      content accurate, Canadian Citizenship Untangled app provides a much
      better way to practice for the Canadian Citizenship test. In the Practice
      mode, you are required to answer multiple-choice questions. If you are not
      sure of the answers, you can always tap the help button and you will see
      the correct answer along with their explanations.


      In addition to practice, the Canadian Citizenship Untangled app has exclusive features that are designed to help you with your learning and practice. For example - instant search, smart revision, universal progress tracker and above all illustrated cheat sheets you help you remember the maximum information.
  - text: Don’t worry. Our experts have made sure that they cover the entire book
      without leaving any fact behind. If your practice is 100%, there won’t be
      a single question that you can’t answer.
    title: Am I not taking a risk by not studying from the book?
  - text: Unlike other apps, we do not recommend a personal plan. Instead, we have a
      universal progress tracker i.e. the rings. You should book your test when
      the rings close. Revise while you are waiting for the test by giving mock
      tests.
    title: How long does it take to prep for the Life in the UK Test test?
  - text: >-
      Why Not! You can give unlimited mock tests. These tests are designed on
      exactly the same pattern as the actual Life in the UK Test. Each test is
      45 minutes long with 24 questions. You must score 75% (means 18 or more
      correct answers) to pass the test.


      After attempting each mock test, you can also review your scores which will show you exactly which areas you need to work on.
    title: Can I prepare for my Life in the UK test by just giving Mock Tests?

      Lack of practice is the main cause of failing the test. However,
      nervousness also plays a very important role while giving the test. Both
      of these issues can be overcome if you give enough mock tests.


      The mock tests in the Life in the UK Untangled app are created in the exact pattern as the real test. These tests have the same time limit as the real test. The number of questions is also the same as that in the real test. You can give as many mock tests as you like. A time will come when you think you are ready for the real test.
