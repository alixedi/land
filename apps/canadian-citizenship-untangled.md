      text: Mock Tests are awesome After reading Discover Canada, I needed to do some
        practice tests. This app has unlimited tests. I attempted a few every
        time I had time and it gave me confidence. I will definitely recommend
        this app.

        shows a circle that moves every time I finish a chapter or pass a test.
        It was a great feeling when I finally completed the whole circle.

      text: Passed after practicing for 2 weeks I found reading from Discover Canada
        quite hard and I kept forgetting the dates. Your app has a really nice
        way of helping memorize dates and events. I had no plans to prepare from
        anything else except Discover Canada but my roommate referred this app
        and Im so grateful that she did. I passed my test after practicing 2
        hours everyday for 2 weeks.

        questions any any other app that I used before this one. Also there are
        unlimited tests. So when I finished my practice, all I did was practice
        my timing with these mock tests. On test day I was feeling very
        confident and found the test quite easy.

  - title: Why should I buy Canadian Citizenship Untangled app instead of the
      official Handbook?
    text: >-
      Canadian Citizenship Untangled has carefully curated 600 plus practice
      questions, straight from *the Discover Canada* handbook. While keeping the
      content accurate, the Canadian Citizenship Untangled app provides a much
      better way to practice for the Canadian Citizenship test. In the Practice
      mode, you are required to answer multiple-choice questions. If you are not
      sure of the answers, you can always tap the help button and you will see
      the correct answer along with their explanations.


      In addition to practice, the Canadian Citizenship Untangled app has exclusive features that are designed to help you with your learning and practice. For example - instant search, smart revision, universal progress tracker and above all illustrated cheat sheets help you remember the maximum information.
  - text: Don’t worry. Our expert content developers have spent considerable time
      creating the questions database. It has been their priority to
      cover *Discover Canada* entirely without leaving any facts behind. If your
      practice is 100%, there won’t be a single question that you can’t answer
      in your Canadian citizenship test.
    title: Am I not taking a risk by not studying from Discover Canada?
  - text: Some users have claimed that they practised for 2 whole days and
      passed.  We recommend that you choose your pace, considering the time you
      can spend on the preparation. Canadian Citizenship Untangled has a
      built-in universal progress tracker in the form of rings. These rings move
      as you proceed with your practice. Once the rings close, it means you are
      ready to book your test. And as you wait for the test date, give the final
      touches to your practice by giving mock tests. There are unlimited mock
      tests.
    title: How long does it take to prep for the Canadian citizenship test?
  - text: >-
      Why Not! You can give unlimited mock tests. These tests are designed on
      exactly the same pattern as the actual Canadian Citizenship Test. Each
      test is 30 minutes long with 20 questions. You must get  15 or more
      answers correct to pass the test.


      After attempting each mock test, you can also review your scores which will show you exactly which areas you need to work on.
    title: Can I prepare for my Canadian citizenship test by just giving Mock Tests?
  - text: Yes. We regularly update our app in accordance with *Discover Canada* -
      the official handbook. All the content in the Canadian Citizenship
      Untangled app is carefully developed by expert content developers.
    title: Does the app have all the updated content?
  - text: >-
      Yes! The Canadian Citizenship Untangled app works on the iPad as well as
      Android Tablets.


      In addition, we have made certain adjustments so that our users have a pleasant experience, practising with a larger screen.
    title: Does the Canadian Citizenship Untangled app work on the iPad or Android
      Tablets?
  - text: Yes! We have designed the Canadian Citizenship Untangled app to be easy to
      use. Every feature, every detail is meticulously designed to help you pass
      the Canadian Citizenship test.
    title: Is the Canadian Citizenship Untangled app easy to use?
  - text: >-
      No doubt! You can use the Review section in the app to get all the
      questions in place that you get frequently or recently wrong during
      practice or tests.


      Also, you can use the Search section in the app to look for any particular word or phrase. This will show you the list of questions that include that particular word or phrase.
    title: Is the Canadian Citizenship Untangled app useful while doing last-minute
      preparation?
  - text: >-
      You can use the Review section in the app to get all the questions that
      you frequently or recently got wrong during preparation or in your last
      test in one place.


      You can also review the scores of all your attempted tests, which will show you the areas you need to practise more.
    title: How does the Review section in the app works?
  - text: The search section can be used anytime in the app to look for any
      particular word or phrase if you can't remember which topic it lies in or
      if you don't want to go through the whole topic.
    title: What does the Search section do?
  - text: >-
      Lack of practice is the main cause of failing the test. However,
      nervousness also plays a very important role while giving the test. Both
      of these issues can be overcome if you give enough mock tests.


      The mock tests in the Canadian Citizenship Untangled app are created in the exact pattern as the real test. These tests have the same time limit as the real test. The number of questions is also the same as that in the real test. You can give as many mock tests as you like. A time will come when you think you are ready for the real test.
