      Our smart HazardGuide shows you exactly how you will be scored on the real
      test. This way you can learn to spot the developing hazards quickly.


      All the latest 34 Hazard Perceptions videos from DVSA are included in the Motorcycle Theory Untangled app.


      P.S. The additional clips - that some apps claim to have - are unofficial and often not up to date.

      Review feature keeps track of all the questions you find tricky and stores
      them in a handy list for revision.

    - name: Alan
      text: I'm so glad I bought this app. The app I was practising with before had
        the worst way of explaining hazard perception. This app made hazard
        perception a lot easier.
      stars: ★★★★★
    - name: Ali Z
      text: Passed my test the first time because of this app. It has all 34 DVSA
        hazard perception video clips, 10 case studies that cover real-life
        scenarios, all the questions from the DVSA practice bank. It also allows
        me to search for terms. Finally, just before the test, I was able to
        revise all the questions that I found difficult thanks to the review
        feature.
      stars: ★★★★
faqs:
  - title: What if the Motorcycle Theory Untangled not right for me?
    text: No problem! Just send an email and we'll refund you, no questions asked.
  - title: How long does it take to prep for the motorcycle theory test?
    text: Unlike other apps, we do not recommend a personal plan. Instead, we have a
      universal progress tracker i.e. the rings. You should book your theory
      test when the rings close. Revise while you are waiting for the test.
  - title: Are case studies included in the Motorcycle Theory Untangled app?
    text: Yes. We have added case studies and made them part of the practice. As you
      proceed with the practice you will find case studies in the same section.
  - title: Why should I buy the Motorcycle Theory Untangled app instead of the
      official DVSA app?
    text: We have licensed the official DVSA revision bank and hazard perception
      clips and so our app has the same content as the official app. In addition
      to DVSA-licensed content, the Motorcycle Theory Untangled app has
      exclusive features that are designed to help you over the line. For
      example - hazard guide, instant search, smart revision and a universal
      progress tracker.
  - title: Why does the Motorcycle Theory Untangled app have only 34 hazard
      perception clips?
    text: The 34 hazard perception clips in the Motorcycle Theory Untangled app are
      the only hazard perception clips that are being licensed by DVSA at the
      moment. Other apps that claim to have more clips are either not official
      or worse - old clips that are not compatible with the current hazard
      perception test requirements.
  - title: Does the Motorcycle Theory Untangled app work on the iPad or Android
      Tablets?
    text: Yes! The Motorcycle Theory Untangled app works on the iPad as well as
      Android Tablets. In fact, we have made certain adjustments so that our
      users have a pleasant experience with a larger screen.
  - title: Is the Motorcycle Theory Untangled app easy to use?
    text: Yes! We have designed the Motorcycle Theory Untangled app to be easy to
      use. Every feature, every detail is meticulously designed to help you get
      our users ready to pass their theory test.
