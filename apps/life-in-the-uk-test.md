## Life in the UK Test Guide

Life in the UK is a computer-based test aimed to prove that the applicant for British Citizenship or Settlement has sufficient knowledge of British life and sufficient proficiency in the English language

This test includes topics such as British values, history, traditions and everyday life and is compiled from the official handbook  **[The Official Life in the United Kingdom - A Guide for New Residents (3rd edition) handbook](https://www.officiallifeintheuk.co.uk/shop)**.

Testing is not directly administered by UK Visas and Immigration but is carried out by Learndirect, a private company.

Visit [here](https://www.gov.uk/life-in-the-uk-test) to book your life in the UK test.

### Who needs to take the test?

Life in the UK Test is a part of the application for **British citizenship** or Indefinite Leave to Remain (also called **settlement)** in the United Kingdom under the [Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationality,_Immigration_and_Asylum_Act_2002).

Find detailed and authentic information [here](https://www.gov.uk/indefinite-leave-to-remain) about everything you need to know about settlement and becoming a British citizen.

Firstly you need to confirm if you need to give the Life in the UK Test.

[This](https://www.gov.uk/settle-in-the-uk/y) checklist provides different situations. If your situation is met by one of those on this list then you are required to give the test.

### Exemptions

You are exempted from giving the test if you

- are less than 18 years or over 65 years of age
- have a long-term physical or mental condition

Use this [form](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/751589/Form_Waiver_KOLL_.pdf), requesting a waiver in giving the life in the UK test. This form must be filled out by a qualified medical professional on behalf of applicants applying for settlement or naturalisation as British citizens.

### Booking Life in the UK Test

This depends upon the amount of time you have for preparing for the test and the kind of learner you are.  Ideally, you should book at least 1 month in advance and dedicate that 1 month to preparing.

You must book your Life in the UK Test online at least 3 days in advance.

This is the only official government service for booking the Life in the UK Test. Use this [link](https://www.gov.uk/life-in-the-uk-test) to book your Life in the UK test.

### Documents needed for booking

The following three things are required to book your test.

1. Email address
2. Debit or credit card
3. An accepted form of ID (this can be a valid passport, a valid travel document with a photo, a biometric residence permit or a biometric residence card).

### The test fee

The test costs **£50**.

Additional **£12.99** if you buy the [Official Guide to New Residents Book](https://www.officiallifeintheuk.co.uk/shop/official-guide-new-residents-book).

Another way is to prepare from a mobile app. There are a number of apps available in both Apple App Store and Google Play store. Some apps available in the stores are free, but we would strongly advise against using them. These free apps are loaded with ads and are huge time wasters.

You should go for the app that is worth its value. On average a decent app costs somewhere between **£4 - £6.** While purchasing the app, make sure it has enough practice questions and unlimited mock tests. So you can gain confidence as you practice.

### The test centre

At the time of booking, you can choose where you want to take your test, depending upon your location and convenience.

There are 30 centres across the UK where you can give your test.


## Preparation

### How long does one need to study for life in the UK test?

It depends upon a lot of factors. For example how much time you get every day to practice, what kind of a learner you are, and how much you already know about the traditions, values and history of the United Kingdom.

The first choice should always be to read the official handbook.  But sometimes, reading a book gets dull and tiresome (and boring).

Compared to reading the book, there is another solution in the form of mobile apps. Depending upon which app you are using. Some apps are so smart that they have a way to record the questions you have trouble answering. A book cannot do that.

There are plenty of apps in the app stores (both apple and android) that can do that for you. Choose the one that identifies your problem areas and helps you overcome those. The best app would be the one that would not require you to read the book at all

### Preparing with Life in the UK test handBook

Reading from the official handbook is the most reliable way to pass the test. If you manage to read the whole book and learn all the facts just by reading then no doubt you are going to pass on your first attempt.

However, for a great number of people, reading a book can get overwhelming. There are too many facts, figures and dates to remember. Also reading a book gets monotonous and tiresome.

### Preparing from a mobile app

If you choose the right app, you will be able to prepare in less time as compared to preparing from the handbook.

When choosing a mobile app, you must make sure that it covers the entire handbook. This is easily determined by the number of practice questions in the app. The more the questions, the more chance there is that it covers the handbook.

Also, choose an app with a maximum or unlimited number of tests. This will help you gain confidence as you go.

Thirdly, make sure that the app uses a visual representation of information that includes dates, facts, years, events etc. This makes learning easy and fun.

## All about the t**est**

### Test structure

The test consists of questions covering topics such as British values, history, traditions and everyday life, compiled from **[The Official Life in the United Kingdom - A Guide for New Residents (3rd edition) handbook](https://www.officiallifeintheuk.co.uk/shop)**.

The test lasts for 45 minutes, during which time the candidate is required to answer 24 multiple-choice questions. To pass the test, the candidate must receive a grade of 75% or higher, i.e. at least 18 correct answers to the 24 questions.

### Passing rate

The passing rate after the introduction of new study material of **[The Official Life in the United Kingdom - A Guide for New Residents (3rd edition) handbook](https://www.officiallifeintheuk.co.uk/shop)** is an average of 70%.

### Before the test

When you reach the test centre, you will be required to keep all your belongings (including your mobile phone, handbag and coat) in a locker. You will then be taken to a room where your ID is checked. You must bring the same ID that you used to book the test. Your photo will also be taken on the day to confirm your ID. You will not be able to take the test and you will not get a refund if you do not bring the correct ID or if you refuse to have your photo taken.

You will then be taken to the test room.

### During the test

In the test room, you may find other candidates giving tests as well. Each candidate is given a different test so there is no chance of any unfair practice.

When the tests start, you will be given a few practice questions (don’t worry if you get them wrong, they will not affect your final score). These questions are given to make sure that you understand the procedure and get familiar with the testing software.

### After the test

Upon completion of the test, successful candidates will be informed that they have passed and will be given a **Pass Notification Letter** that they will have to sign. the Pass Notification letter contains a ‘unique reference number’. This number will be needed to complete your citizenship or settlement application. The Home Office will check through this reference number that you’ve passed.

Unsuccessful candidates will learn the topics that they should study further.

### If you fail the test

You must wait at least 7 days before taking the test again. You can take the test as many times as you need to. However,  you will need to book the test and pay again each time.

Sometimes it's difficult to carry a book at all times, whereas your mobile phone is with you every time you go out. Also, many mobile apps come with practice questions.

But, be wary of the fact that not all mobile apps do what they promise.

Also, choose an app with a maximum or unlimited number of tests. This will help you gain confidence as you go.

Thirdly, make sure that the app uses a visual representation of information that includes dates, facts, years, events etc. This makes learning easy and fun.
