      text: I'm impressed with how easy the app works. It shows a circle that moves
        every time I finish a chapter or pass a test. It was a great feeling
        when I finally completed the whole circle.

      stars: Excellent App ★★★★★
    - name: user250380
      text: I have not found this many practice questions in any other app that I used
        before this one. Also there are unlimited tests. So when I finished my
        practice, all I did was  practice my timing with these mock tests. On
        test day I was feeling very confident and found the test quite easy.
      stars: So easy to use!  ★★★★★

      text: I PASSED MY TEST TODAY. Before using this app, I tried quite a few other
        apps but I wasn’t satisfied because their question bank did not cover
        the whole our common bond book. When I saw this app has 300 plus
        questions, I immediately installed it and it covers EVERYTHING.
      stars: Excellent quizzes ★★★★★

        I had a great time preparing for my test. It has a unique way of measuring the progress. It also tells you when you are ready for the actual test. There are unlimited tests in the exact same manner as the actual test. The best part is that I never once read Discover Canada.
      stars: I passed today  ★★★★★

  - title: Why should I buy the Australian Test Untangled app instead of the Our
      Common Bond handbook?
    text: >-
      While keeping the content accurate, we provide a much better way to
      practice for the Australian citizenship test. While practice, you are
      required to answer multiple-choice questions. If you are not sure of the
      answers, you can always tap the help button and you will see the correct
      answer along with their explanations.


      In addition to practice, the Australian Test Untangled app has exclusive features that are designed to help you over the line. For example - instant search, smart revision and a universal progress tracker.
  - text: Don’t worry. Our experts have made sure that they cover the entire book
      without leaving any fact behind. If your practice is 100%, there won’t be
      a single question that you can’t answer.
    title: Am I not taking a risk by not studying from Our Common Bond handbook?
  - text: We think that you can easily prepare for your test in 7 days. If you are
      preparing exclusively. If not, we have a universal progress tracker in the
      form of rings. YOu can see the rings progressing as youmove on with your
      practice. You should book your test when the rings close. Revise while you
      are waiting for the test by giving mock tests.
    title: How long does it take to prep for the Australian citizenship test?
  - text: >-
      Why Not! You can give unlimited mock tests. These tests are designed on
      exactly the same pattern as the actual Australian citizenship test. Each
      test is 45 minutes long with 20 questions. You must answer 15 questions
      correctly to pass the test. Also there are 5 questions in the test from
      Australian Values. You must answer all the Australain Values questions
      correctly.

      word or phrase if you cant remember which topic it lies in or if you don't

  - text: >-
      Lack of practice is the main cause of failing the test. However,
      nervousness also plays a very important role while giving the test. Both
      of these issues can be overcome if you give enough mock tests.
