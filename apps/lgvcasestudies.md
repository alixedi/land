      text: I'm still surprised at the price of this app. Other apps on app store
        claim to give the same thing but they charge 3 times more.
      stars: great price. definitely recommend ★★★★★
    - text: Really well-written case studies that cover a lot of topics. A bit too
        long as compared to the actual test but good for practice. I would
        recommend this app to all future lorry drivers.

      stars: Good case study practice ★★★★★
faqs:
  - title: What if the LGV Case Studies Untangled not right for me?
    text: No problem! Just send an email and we'll refund you, no questions asked.
  - title: How long does it take to prep for the theory test?
    text: Unlike other apps, we do not recommend a personal plan. Instead, we have a
      universal progress tracker i.e. the rings. You should book your theory
      test when the rings close. Revise while you are waiting for the test.
  - title: Why should I buy the LGV Case Studies Untangled app instead of the
      official DVSA app?
    text: >-
      We have licensed the official DVSA revision bank and hazard perception
      clips and so our app has the same content as the official app.


      In addition to DVSA-licensed content, the LGV Case StudiesUntangled app has exclusive features that are designed to help you over the line. For example - hazard guide, instant search, smart revision and a universal progress tracker.
  - title: Does the LGV Case Studies Untangled app work on the iPad or Android
      Tablets?
    text: >-
      Yes! The LGV Case Studies Untangled app works on the iPad as well as
      Android Tablets.


      In fact, we have made certain adjustments so that our users have a pleasant experience with a larger screen.
  - title: Is the LGV Case Studies Untangled app easy to use?
    text: Yes! We have designed the LGV Case Studies Untangled app to be easy to
      use. Every feature, every detail is meticulously designed to help you get
      our users ready to pass the LGV theory test.
