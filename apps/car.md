  - title: When the rings close, you are ready
    description: >-
      Unlike other driving theory apps, we do not propose personal plans.
      Instead, we track your progress with 2 rings - one for practice and one
      for test.


      When the rings are about to close, book your driving theory test.

      text: Passed my test first time because of this app. It has all 34 DVSA hazard
        perception video clips, 10 case studies that cover real-life scenarios,
        all the questions from the DVSA practice bank. It also allows me to
        search for terms. Finally, just before the test, I was able to revise
        all the questions that I found difficult thanks to the review feature.

faqs:
  - title: What if the Driving Theory Untangled not right for me?
    text: No problem! Just send an email and we'll refund you, no questions asked.
  - title: How long does it take to prep for the theory test?
    text: Unlike other apps, we do not recommend a personal plan. Instead, we have a
      universal progress tracker i.e. the rings. You should book your theory
      test when the rings close. Revise while you are waiting for the test.
  - title: Are the new video case studies included in the Driving Theory Untangled
      app?
    text: Yes. The last 3 questions in every mock-test in the Driving Theory
      Untangled app are based on a video case study. You can also practice video
      case studies like other multiple-choice questions.
  - title: Why should I buy the Driving Theory Untangled app instead of the official
      DVSA app?
    text: >-
      We have licensed the official DVSA revision bank and hazard perception
      clips and so our app has the same content as the official app.


      In addition to DVSA-licensed content, the Driving Theory Untangled app has exclusive features that are designed to help you over the line. For example - hazard guide, instant search, smart revision and a universal progress tracker.
  - title: Why does the Driving Theory Untangled app have only 34 hazard perception
      clips?
    text: >-
      The 34 hazard perception clips in the Driving Theory Untangled app are the
      only hazard perception clips that are being licensed by DVSA at the
      moment.


      Other apps that claim to have more clips are either not official or worse - old clips that are not compatible with the current hazard perception test requirements.
  - title: Does the Driving Theory Untangled app work on the iPad or Android Tablets?
    text: >-
      Yes! The Driving Theory Untangled app works on the iPad as well as Android
      Tablets.


      In fact, we have made certain adjustments so that our users have a pleasant experience with a larger screen.
  - title: Is the Driving Theory Untangled app easy to use?
    text: Yes! We have designed the Driving Theory Untangled app to be easy to use.
      Every feature, every detail is meticulously designed to help you get our
      users ready to pass the driving theory test.
