  - title: When the rings close, you are ready
    description: The LGV Theory Untangled app will track your progress in form of
      rings. The rings move as you learn new chapters and attempt mock tests.
      This makes things simple - Install the app, close the rings, pass your LGV
      Theory Test.

  - title: The HazardGuide show you exactly how you will be scored
    description: >-
      Our smart HazardGuide shows you exactly how you will be scored on the real
      test. This way you can learn to spot the developing hazards quickly.


      All the latest 34 Hazard Perceptions videos from DVSA are included in the LGV Theory Untangled app.


      P.S. The additional clips - that some apps claim to have - are unofficial and often not up to date.

      text: I installed this app just to practice mock tests for CPC 1. What I found
        great was that there unlimited tests on the same pattern as the real
        test. I attempted a lot of tests and every test gave me more confidence.
        I passed.
      stars: Great for practising tests ★★★★★
    - text: As compared to other apps for CPC1, I find this app rather simple which
        works for me. It doesnt waste time. Although sometimes the repetation of
        same questions becomes somewhat frustrating but according to their
        method (cant remember what it's called) it helps the brain to remember.
        Which was  right. By the end of practice I was able to recall all the
        answers that I kept forgetting in the beginning.
      name: Zaidi
      stars: Reliable. Definitely Recommend ★★★★★
faqs:
  - title: What if the LGV Theory Untangled not right for me?
    text: No problem! Just send an email and we'll refund you, no questions asked.
  - title: How long does it take to prep for the theory test?
    text: Unlike other apps, we do not recommend a personal plan. Instead, we have a
      universal progress tracker i.e. the rings. You should book your theory
      test when the rings close. Revise while you are waiting for the test.
  - title: Why should I buy the LGV Theory Untangled app instead of the official
      DVSA app?
    text: >-
      We have licensed the official DVSA revision bank and hazard perception
      clips and so our app has the same content as the official app.


      In addition to DVSA-licensed content, the LGV Theory Untangled app has exclusive features that are designed to help you over the line. For example - hazard guide, instant search, smart revision and a universal progress tracker.
  - title: Why does the LGV Theory Untangled app have only 34 hazard perception clips?
    text: >-
      The 34 hazard perception clips in the LGVTheory Untangled app are the only
      hazard perception clips that are being licensed by DVSA at the moment.


      Other apps that claim to have more clips are either not official or worse - old clips that are not compatible with the current hazard perception test requirements.
  - title: Does the LGV Theory Untangled app work on the iPad or Android Tablets?
    text: >-
      Yes! The LGV Theory Untangled app works on the iPad as well as Android
      Tablets.


      In fact, we have made certain adjustments so that our users have a pleasant experience with a larger screen.
  - title: Is the LGV Theory Untangled app easy to use?
    text: Yes! We have designed the LGV Theory Untangled app to be easy to use.
      Every feature, every detail is meticulously designed to help you get our
      users ready to pass the LGV theory test.
